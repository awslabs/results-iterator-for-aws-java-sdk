Results iterator for AWS SDK
----------------------------

This example code contains a library that can be used to iterate over results from calls to the AWS SDK without duplicating code.

To see how it is used look at the tests in the [BasicResultsIteratorTest class in the Jitpack project](../../results-iterator-jitpack/java/src/test/java/com/awslabs/aws/iot/resultsiterator/BasicResultsIteratorTest.java).
